# Wombats Go Authentication

This package uses the [Gorilla web toolkit](http://www.gorillatoolkit.org/)'s sessions and context
packages to implement a user authorization system for web servers written in Go.

See examples for example usage.

**Note**

This is the first time I've worked with implementing the details of cookie storage, authentication
or any sort of real security. There are no guarantees that this will work as expected, but I'd love
feedback. If you have any issues or suggestions, please [let me
know](https://github.com/Wombats/goauth/issues/new).

### TODO

- User roles
- Documentation/Better comments
- Testing
- User data validation for registration
